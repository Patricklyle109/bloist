/* BLOIST-ANNOTATED-FILE: reveal.css
   PURPOSE: Site-wide styling for www.bloist.com.
   WHERE TO EDIT:
     - Color theme variables live near the top (look for :root { --... }).
     - Buttons and navigation styles are used across every page.
   COMMON ISSUES + FIXES:
     - Dropdowns closing too fast: see assets/js/main.js event handling (pointer + focus).
     - Contrast problems: adjust --text / --muted / --card and re-test headings.
